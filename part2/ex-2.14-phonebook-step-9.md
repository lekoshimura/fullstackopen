# 2.14: The Phonebook step 9

Make it possible for users to delete entries from the phonebook. The deletion can be done through a dedicated button for each person in the phonebook list. You can confirm the action from the user by using the window.confirm method.

The associated resource for a person in the backend can be deleted by making an HTTP DELETE request to the resource's URL. If we are deleting e.g. a person who has the id 2, we would have to make an HTTP DELETE request to the URL localhost:3001/persons/2. No data is sent with the request.

You can make an HTTP DELETE request with the axios library in the same way that we make all of the other requests.

NB: You can't use the name delete for a variable because it's a reserved word in JavaScript. E.g. the following is not possible:

```jsx
// use some other name for variable!
const delete = (id) => {
  // ...
}
```
