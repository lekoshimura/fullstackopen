# 2.11: The Phonebook Step 6

We continue with developing the phonebook. Store the initial state of the application in the file db.json, which should be placed in the root of the project.

```json
{
  "persons":[
    { 
      "name": "Arto Hellas", 
      "number": "040-123456",
      "id": "1"
    },
    { 
      "name": "Ada Lovelace", 
      "number": "39-44-5323523",
      "id": "2"
    },
    { 
      "name": "Dan Abramov", 
      "number": "12-43-234345",
      "id": "3"
    },
    { 
      "name": "Mary Poppendieck", 
      "number": "39-23-6423122",
      "id": "4"
    }
  ]
}
```

Start json-server on port 3001 and make sure that the server returns the list of people by going to the address http://localhost:3001/persons in the browser.

Modify the application such that the initial state of the data is fetched from the server using the axios-library. Complete the fetching with an Effect hook.
