# 2.1: Course information step 6

Let's finish the code for rendering course contents from exercises 1.1 - 1.5. You can start with the code from the model answers. The model answers for part 1 can be found by going to the [submission system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen), clicking on my submissions at the top, and in the row corresponding to part 1 under the solutions column clicking on show. To see the solution to the course info exercise, click on App.jsx under courseinfo.

Note that if you copy a project from one place to another, you might have to delete the node_modules directory and install the dependencies again with the command npm install before you can start the application.

Generally, it's not recommended that you copy a project's whole contents and/or add the node_modules directory to the version control system.

Let's change the App component like so:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10,
        id: 1
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7,
        id: 2
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14,
        id: 3
      }
    ]
  }

  return <Course course={course} />
}

export default App
```

Define a component responsible for formatting a single course called Course.

The component structure of the application can be, for example, the following:

```
App
  Course
    Header
    Content
      Part
      Part
      ...
```

You don't need the sum of the exercises yet.

The application must work regardless of the number of parts a course has, so make sure the application works if you add or remove parts of a course.

Ensure that the console shows no errors!
