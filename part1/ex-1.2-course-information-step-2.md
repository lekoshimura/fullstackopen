# 1.2: Course Information, step 2

Refactor the *Content* component so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead, it only renders three *Part* components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

```jsx
const Content = ... {
  return (
    <div>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Our application passes on information in quite a primitive way at the moment, since it is based on individual variables. We shall fix that in part 2, but before that, let's go to part1b to learn about JavaScript.
