# 1.5: Course Information step 5

Let's take the changes one step further. Change the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: "Half Stack application development",
    parts: [
      {
        name: "Fundamentals of React",
        exercises: 10,
      },
      {
        name: "Using props to pass data",
        exercises: 7,
      },
      {
        name: "State of a component",
        exercises: 14,
      },
    ],
  };

  return <div>...</div>;
};
```
